# GettingAndCleaningData_Project
Getting and Cleaning Data - Project
The purpose of the project is to be able to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The data for this project can be downloaded from the website - [link](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). The description of the data is available at [link] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
**Note** The run_analysis.R file and the data have to be in the same folder.
The run_analysis.R file contains the following functionality:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
6. Save the data to the file - tidy_data.txt
